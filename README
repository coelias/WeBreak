======================================================================

WeBreak aims to be a web application bruteforcer, making a strong effort 
in usability, fexibility and performance.

It must be read as "We Break", that is what we use/like to do :P.

I decided to start this project in order to improve and mix my previous
security tools (Wfuzz,ProxyStrike, and the first version of WeBreak)

Features
========
Console and web based interface
Fuzzing engine
Dictionary generator
Plugins Engine
Sql injection Plugin
XSS Plugin
Passive proxy
and even more!!!

TODO
====
Everything! O_o

Cheers!
